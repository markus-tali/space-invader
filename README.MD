Audit test questions here: [audit](https://01.kood.tech/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/make-your-game/audit)

I strongly recommend git pull before you start. There has been problems in the past with files not being correct version.

I recommend using VScode "Live Server" extension for testing the game.
Testing process with Live server:

1. Start the live-server. Right click on game.html and click "Open with Live Server"
2. Navigate to the page localhost:5500 (default)
3. Play!
4. After testing press F1 and click stop Live Server (or exit VScode)

# Game instructions

The goal of the game is to destroy all the enemies as fast as possible without getting killed. You have 3 lives to kill all of them!
To start the game press enter!

### Thank you for auditing!!
